## Entering an End-of-File from the Keyboard

When we enter input to a program from the keyboard, different operating systems use different conventions to allow us to indicate end-of-file. On Windows systems we enter an end-of-file by typing a control-z—hold down the Ctrl key and press z—followed by hitting either the Enter or Return key. On UNIX systems, including on Mac OS X machines, end-of-file is usually control-d.
